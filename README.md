# RPG_GrassCuttingNotZeldaShop
Welcome to the read me file for my RPG Game!

To play the game, run the "RPG_GrassCutting.exe - Shortcut" File.
or navigate through \RPG_GrassCutting\bin\Debug and run RPG_GrassCutting.exe

The SLN folder is located right below the .exe shortcut for running the game if you'd like to look into the code.

At the start of the game you can either choose to start a brand new game(which you should if you are new)
or load your most recent save

You get dialogue and start off with 10 rupees, you are told about your goal to get 50k rupees
and then you are sent to the shop.

In the shop you can purchase items to keep your health and hunger topped off, or purchase a weapon upgrade
to increase the rate that you earn rupees when you go home and work.

You can sell items, you can check your inventory and use/eat items

And you can quit the game, which is the only way to save your progress, so on your next start up of the game
if you choose to load, it will boot up that last save.


The main gameplay loop is going home and buying food, while saving enough money for the next sword/job upgrade
which makes it easier to get more rupees, once you get the finaly upgrade, you grind to save up to 50k and go home
then the game will ask if you would like to purchase your dream home and go out on an adventure(ending the game).
